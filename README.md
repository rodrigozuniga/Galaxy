The run_analysis.R script does the following:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
(meanFreq is not included).
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- creates a second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
